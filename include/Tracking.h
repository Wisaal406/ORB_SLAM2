/** \brief Tracker. It receives a frame and computes the associated camera pose.
*
* Tracker is one of the main threads of System (it runs within the main thread).
* It also decides when to insert a new keyframe, create some new MapPoints and
* performs relocalization if tracking fails. Relocalization is important if tracking
* is lost due to sudden large motions or reinitialization of the system. The
* Tracking thread produces a KeyFrame when it is required.
*
* Whenever a frame is grabbed from the camera, the main stages in tracking are:
* * Pre-process input to get ORB features and triangulate points, where possible (implemented in Frame)
* * Camera position estimation or relocation (Tracking::Track)
